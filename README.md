# Predictive Maintenance System for Automotive Vehicles

## Problem Statement
Unplanned vehicle failures lead to increased downtime and maintenance costs.
This project predicts the probability of component failure using sensor data.

## Dataset
NASA CMAPSS Turbofan Engine Degradation Dataset

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- FastAPI
- Streamlit
- AWS EC2

## Model
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost (Final Model)

## Features
- Sensor lag & difference features
- Failure risk classification
- REST API deployment
- Interactive UI for predictions

## Deployment
- Backend: FastAPI (Uvicorn)
- Frontend: Streamlit
- Hosted on AWS EC2

## Output
- Failure Probability
- Failure Risk (0 / 1)
